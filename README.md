# An Ordinary Macropad
## What does it do you ask? Well, Macropad Stuff
### I told you, it's nothing special, just ordinary

Why press multiple keys at once on your keyboard to run a task, just bind it to one key!

Alright now you may be thinking, how was it made?

Well tbh, idk...

I was expecting it to break, and well it kinda did for the first 2 pcbs, mainly coz of my terrible soldering

But then, something happened, it finally worked

How? don't ask

All I know is that it works, and the keys are badly soldered so some are higher than others

And the thing doesn't stay flat coz the diodes are badly aligned

And a case?

well I got a 3d printer thanks to arcade... I just gotta finish the design

When will I do that?

Eventually.

Okay, thats enough yapping from me, go make your own macropad to do macropad stuff

How? Don't ask me, figure it out, make it different, better, faster, *nicely soldered*

Just have fun making it, I know for sure I did

Thats it from me, cya..
